    "This was the setup of the challenge:\n",
    " - Rounds are run every 2-4 minutes for 120 minutes\n",
    " - Each round 10000 hands are played\n",
    " - Player order is shuffled before each hand, however the Dealer always goes last\n",
    " - A hand consists of each player taking it in turns to 'hit' or 'stick'\n",
    " - Like normal Blackjack (AKA 21), a player can 'hit' as many times as they like, stopping either by 'sticking' or by going bust\n",
    " - Unlike normal Blackjack, players start with no cards, will go bust if their cards total 1 or more, and each card has a uniformly random value (0, 1)\n",
    " - Also unlike normal Blackjack, the Dealer does not follow a published set of steps, it just follows the same game rules as everyone else and tries to win\n",
    " \n",
    "The scoring went as follows:\n",
    " - At the end of each round, teams are ranked based on hand wins\n",
    " - The team with the most hand wins gets X points, 2nd place gets X/2 points, 3rd place gets X/3, and so on\n",
    " - X is equal to the round number squared, i.e. 10000 in the first round, 40000 in the second, 90000 in the third, and so on.\n",
    " - Teams that are tied receive the same number of points, and then a gap is left in the rankings, i.e. if teams A & B tie for first, they both receive X points, and the next team C receives X/3 points\n",
    " - 10,000 hand rounds may be split into multiple sub-rounds of 2,500 hands or fewer - each sub-round is scored independently in this case\n",
    " - There is no cost to playing a round or hand, and there is no penalty for losing a hand."

    "For each hand a given team participates in, their Python submission is executed. The method  play_hand() is called (if defined correctly). This method allows for various other methods and variables included in the Challenge API to be used in order to implement the desired playing strategy:\n",
    " - hit(): a function you can invoke in order to take a card. It returns the value of your new card. It does not return a cumulative total\n",
    " - hand_number: an integer representing the current hand number in this round, indexed from 1\n",
    " - player_count: an integer count of the number of players in this round, including the dealer\n",
    " - current_hand:  list of named tuples, [(team_id: integer, cards: [float])] containing the cards that each team before you received, delivered as cumulative card totals. If a player didn't hit() at all, then the contents will be [0.0], otherwise it will contain the cumulative totals of their cards, e.g. for a player that hit() three times and went bust, the array would contain [0.0, 0.529, 0.82, 1.5]. The current_hand list will be empty if you are going first in the hand, or will contain player_count - 2 elements if you are playing just before the Dealer.\n",
    " team_order: list of integers representing the team ids of each player in this hand, in the order that they will play. This includes the dealer who will always appear last.\n",
    " - previous_hands: list of lists, [[(team_id: integer, cards: [float])]] containing the cumulative card totals, as described above, for all teams (including your team), but for all previous hands in this round\n",
